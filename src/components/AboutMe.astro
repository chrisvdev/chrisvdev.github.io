          Hello, everyone! My name is Christian, and I am a Full Stack
          Developer.
        </p>
        <p class="dwarf:text-base sm:text-lg 2xl:text-xl mb-2">

          skills and experience to meet your needs.

        </p>
        <p class="dwarf:text-base sm:text-lg 2xl:text-xl mb-2">
          My background in computer technology has given me a deep understanding
          of programming, and my experience as a photographer has honed my
          skills in composition, visual language, and colorimetry. This
          combination of skills allows me to create better BackEnd, FrontEnd and UX.
        </p>

          I am also well-versed in Scrum and agile methodologies, and my strong
          communication skills make me an asset to any team. So, if you are
          building a team or already have one in place, I can seamlessly
          integrate and contribute to the team's success.

          amazing things happen!
