    message: `Hello! üëãüèª My name is Christian and I have the confidence to tell you that if you entered here looking for a Full Stack Developer that provides solutions, you will find it in me üòä. Why?
    Now as a Full Stack Developer thanks to Henry, I am up to date with the technologies that the market demands.
    I am attentive to the technologies that are to come, I strongly rely on the new ones, on my background and experience as a computer technician, which gave me the knowledge to understand what programming is all about and what is required to perform DevOps üí™üèª. As a Photographer, knowing about composition, visual language and colorimetry, makes it even easier for me to develop a better FrontEnd and UX üé®.
    Is there already a team in place or are you building one? Apart from knowing how to implement Scrum and what agile methodologies are all about, I have knowledge and experience in communication that will accelerate my integration to the teamüôèüèª.
    Don't delay and contact me. üòâ`,
