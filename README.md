# chrisvill2312.github.io

Here is the development of my own landing page, the first version was a custom copy, with some extra features, made in React.JS (V1 branch), and the current one (V2) is a custom development made with Astro and React.JS, thought to host it in my own server supported by Cloudflare and Cloudinary CDN.

The static parts were developed with Astro and the portfolio is dynamically generated using the Github API with React.JS.
